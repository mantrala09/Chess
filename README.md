# Chess
2D Chess game to be played by two people by running "ChessMain.java". The white pieces are represented by all the pieces whose images on the board end in "1", and the black pieces are all pieces whose images end in "2".

Normal rules of chess apply. Players must respond to checks, cannot castle through check, and can only make moves that do not cause themselves to be in check. If any of these rules are broken, game will prompt user to input a different move.

When one player has no valid moves and is in checkmate, the game is over.
